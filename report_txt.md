#### About 

Per the IRS, a donor advised fund is a fund or account:
1. That is separately identified by reference to contributions of a donor or donors;
2. That is owned and controlled by a sponsoring organization; and 
3. For which the donor or donor advisor has or reasonably expects to have advisory privileges in the distribution or investment of amounts held in the donor advised fund or account because of the donor's status as a donor.

These three conditions allow individuals to make tax-deductible donations to sponsoring organizations, like banks or community foundations. Individuals then recommend which nonprofit organizations should recieve the funds, and the sponsoring organization handles the disbursement of the funds. 



Data is available for all years the IRS-990 has been published for the public.

Data is obtained from the main IRS-990 Form, as well as its Schedule D and Schedule I.

As found [here](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f990si.pdf#page=3&zoom=auto,-336,738), the IRS Form 990 Schedule I is "used by an organization that files Form 990 to provide information on grants and other assistance made by the filing organization during the tax year to domestic organizations, domestic governments, and domestic individuals....Grants and other assistance include awards, prizes, contributions, noncash assistance, cash allocations, stipends, scholarships, fellowships, research grants, and similar payments and distributions made by the organization during the tax year."

#### Important Notes

Note that the publicly available data on donor-advised funds is skewed. Donor-advised funds are only required to disclose information "for each recipient domestic organization or domestic government that received more that $5,000 aggregate of grants or assistance from the organization during the tax year". In addition, the Schedule I does not include any grants or assistance provided to organizations, including domestic, for the purpose of aiding a foreign organization, government, or individual.
